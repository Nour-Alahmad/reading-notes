 # Event Driven Programming

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
   - The native Node.js module that allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming is called "events". It provides the tools and functionality to work with events in Node.js.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
   - Object Oriented Programming (OOP) used in tandem with Event Driven Programming brings several benefits. OOP helps in organizing code into reusable objects, making it easier to manage and maintain. It allows for encapsulation of data and behavior, leading to cleaner and more modular code. When combined with Event Driven Programming, OOP enables us to create event handlers as methods within objects, making the code more structured and readable.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
   - Event Driven Programming on the backend using Node.js allows developers to build highly responsive and efficient applications. Just like how events in the web browser trigger actions like button clicks or form submissions, on the backend, events can be used to handle incoming requests, database queries, or external API calls. By utilizing Event Driven Programming, Node.js can efficiently handle multiple requests concurrently, providing scalability and responsiveness. This approach is particularly useful for building real-time applications, such as chat systems or collaborative tools, where immediate responses are crucial.
