# our idea for today's lab

one possible project idea that we could complete within the allotted time is our "Worldlust" project, which involves building an application with Authorization/Authentication. The main goal of this project is to create a platform where users can explore and interact with different restaurants and choose their favorite.

so today our goal is to build an application that allows users to discover and engage with various restaurants and choose their favorite. To ensure secure access and protect user data, we'll implement robust Authorization/Authentication features.

Our application will have different user roles, including regular users, admins, and owners. Regular users will be able to create accounts, log in, and browse through the restaurant listings. They can mark their favorites, On the other hand, owners will have additional permissions to add and update restaurant information

To make our project functional and user-friendly, we will develop a RESTful API to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for restaurant data and user-related functionalities. We'll implement secure authentication methods, such as password hashing and token-based authentication, to ensure the privacy and integrity of user information.

Once the core functionality is implemented, we'll deploy our application on the Render platform for hosting, and we'll thoroughly test it using tools like Thunder to identify and fix any potential issues or bugs.
