## 1-How would I describe NodeJS to a non-technical friend?

NodeJS is an environment that allows you to build interactive and dynamic webpages using JavaScript, basically it allows you to writea code that runs on your computer rather than only on a web browser, giving you greater autonomy and control over how your website works.

## 2-What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

In simple words, Node is a JavaScript runtime, meaning that it is a tool that allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer without requiring a web browser
Normally, you can only use JavaScript in a web browser, but Node lets you use JavaScript on your computer without a web browser, which gives you more options and power over how your instructions work and what they can do so withe JavaScript you will write instructions to follow and Node allows you to run those instructions on your computer

## 3-What is Node used for?

* Web applications: Because it is quick, scalable, and simple to use, Node.js is a popular choice for developing web apps. It may be used to build both the frontend and backend of a web application.
* Real-time apps: Since it can manage a high number of concurrent connections and is non-blocking, Node.js is well-suited for real-time applications. As a result, it's great for applications like chat servers, video streaming, and online gaming.
* Back-end APIs: itÂ can be used to build APIs for a wide range of applications, including web applications, mobile apps, and IoT devices.
* Command-line tools: also Node.js is commonly used to build command-line tools.

Some examples of websites, or apps that use Node are Netflix, Uber, Slack, and Visual Studio Code.
