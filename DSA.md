# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

## 1-What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

The amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input which is the time complexity of the operations that require to execute on the data structure

## 2-How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

we need to provide a base case or condition that stops the recursion if we want to prevent an infinite recursive call stack, the condition is considered to be a base case if it simply provides a value without making any further recursive calls, and we must also ensure that the recursive calls are approaching the base case by modifying a parameter or variable
